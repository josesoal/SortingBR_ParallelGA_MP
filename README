Introduction
============

This directory contains the source code of the implementation of the following
algorithm:
- Parallel Genetic Algorithm for the SUPBR problem (Parallel-GA).
  (version with multiple populations)

The authors of the implementation are:
	Jose Luis Soncco-Alvarez (jose.soncco.alvarez@gmail.com)
	and
	Mauricio Ayala-Rincon (ayala@unb.br)

Both authors from the Group of Theory of Computation at the University of
Brasilia.

(SUPBR - "Sorting Unsigned Permutations by Reversals")

Setup
=====

The source code was tested under MAC OSX and UBUNTU LINUX platforms. As first
step we need to execute the makefile:
$ make clean all -f makefile.pga

The previous commands will generate the following executable: 
"parallel_ga". 

Input Data
==========

Initially, the input data was intended to be two permutations that correspond
to the gene order of two organisms with the same gene set. We assume that the
genes of the second organism are represented as increasing naturals, leading
to a identity permutation. Then, we JUST NEED as input the first permutation,
which maintains the same natural number representation for each gene but in
the order of the first organism. 

For instance, if the input data is the permutation {2,4,3,1}, it will have the 
following format:
4
2
4
3
1

The first line is the length of the permutation, that is, the number of genes
of an organism. The remaining lines are the gene order of an organism.

The SUPBR problem consists in finding the minimum number of reversals for
transforming an unsigned permutation into the identity permutation.

Usage
=====

The program has the following parameter options:

-s : seed for srand() [default: time(NULL)]
-g : number of generations, for each GA in a slave
     [default: -1 = the input length is the number of generations 
      for each slave)]
-t : total number of generations, distributed equally among the slaves
     [default: -1 = the input length is the number of generations 
      for each slave)]
-e : number of evaluations to stop program 
     [default: -1 = this feature is not used]
-r : number of reversals to stop program 
     [default: -1 = this feature is not used]
-m : print mode [default: final_result]
        options:
        -m final_result : print number of reversals, number of evaluations of
                          fitness function, and number of used generations
        -m best_by_gen  : print the best solution by generation
        -m eval_by_gen  : print the number of evaluations of fitness function
                          by generation
-p : population size for each GA in a slave
     [default: -1 = the population size is nlogn, n is input length]

Note: Do not use the parameters "-g" or "-t" at the same time.

Note: The input permutation must be in a file labeled as "i", in this
      directory is included the file "i" with a permutation of length 50. 	

Examples of use of "parallel_ga":

(1) The following command executes the parallel_ga by using 4 processes (-np)
    one master and 3 slaves, a seed of 77 (-s) for the rand function, 500
    generations for each GA in a slave(-g), and show the best results obtained
    by generation: 
    $ mpirun -np 4 ./parallel_ga -s 77 -g 500 -m best_by_gen

(2) The following command executes the parallel_ga by using 24 processes (-np)
    one master and 23 slaves, a seed defined by time(NULL) for the rand()
    function, 500 generations divided among the slaves processes (-t), a
    population size of 500/23 = 22 for each slave, and show at the end of the
    execution the number of reversals, number of evaluations of the fitness
    function, and number of used generations (-m): 
    $ mpirun -np 24 ./parallel_ga -t 500 -m final_result

(3) The following command executes the parallel_ga by using 24 processes (-np)
    one master and 23 slaves, a random seed of 77 (-s) for the rand function,
    1000 generations for each GA in a slave (-g), 20000 evaluations of the
    fitness function (-e) as stop condition, a population size of 13 (-p) for
    each GA in a slave, and show at the end of the execution the number of
    reversals, number of evaluations of the fitness function, and number of
    used generations (-m):  
    $ mpirun -np 24 ./parallel_ga -s 77 -g 1000 -e 20000 -p 13 -m final_result
